=head1 NAME

Net::SenderBase - Query the senderbase service

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $query = Net::SenderBase::Query->new(
      Transport => 'http',
      Address => $ip,
  );

  my $results = $query->results();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an interface to the SenderBase query service
at L<http://www.senderbase.org/>.

It allows you to query senderbase either via HTTP, or via DNS.
The reason you might choose one or the other are:

=over 4

=item HTTP

HTTP is blocking, but more firewalls allow HTTP queries than
allow DNS queries

=item DNS

DNS queries can be "fired off" early in a script and the results
collected later. This means your query won't block other subsystems
in your program.

=back

Both http and dns queries will return a C<Net::SenderBase::Results>
object.

=head1 Net::SenderBase::Results

This module wraps up the results of a senderbase query in an easy to
use API. The only way to construct one of these objects is to make
a senderbase query and get the results. This object is entirely read
only.
